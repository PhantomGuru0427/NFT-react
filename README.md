# React-NFTs
This is a simple project I built to mint a collection of NFTs. Built using hardhat, ethers.js, Solidity, and React. It includes a smart contract that mints a series of up to 50 unique NFTs from a front-end app. The user can then see the NFT sent to their wallet and on OpenSea.

This is an ongoing project deployed on the Rinkeby testnet. I am currently collaborating with an artist to make the art itself more interesting.
